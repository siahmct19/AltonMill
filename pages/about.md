## Description
In this weeks episode, we visited the Alton Mill Arts Centre to speak with general manager, artist, and cheesemaker Martin Kouprie. Co-hosts Siah McTavish and Ashley Chintan discuss the continuity and change at the heritage site as it engages with contemporary art endeavours, interactive events, and community audiences in a small town with emphasis on local identity.
## Acknowledgments
The creators would like to thank those involved for their time and support:

-Martin Kouprie of the Alton Mill Arts Centre for his time and thoughtful conversation
-The York University Making and Media Creation Lab for accessible workshops and equipment
